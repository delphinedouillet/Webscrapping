# Mission to Mars

I build a web application that scrapes data from five different websites in order to retrieve information about Mars.

I used BeautifulSoup, pandas and splinter in order to scrape and used Flask to run it.

All the collected information was stored in a MongoDB database.

Finally, I created a HTML file called 'index.html' to displaye all of the data.
